        <h2>VICTIM TRANSCRIPT</h2>
        <p>
            I need your help. I am not sure how it happened or what they did, but I got invited into a chatroom and I witnessed a video, a video that never happened, and they have been manipulating me with these videos and images. They know my address; they have all my information. They keep asking me to do things I donâ€™t want to do.
